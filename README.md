# Subtitles for facetime or something like that

Roadmap:
1. Copy someone's voice to text using a library
2. Make my own voice to text program - English and Cantonese
3. Display the text using OpenCV
4. Optimize, display text and video with less memory and resources than OpenCV
5. Video call app
6. Implement both

Use the most efficient method to get a live subtitling plugin or app for Cantonese.
